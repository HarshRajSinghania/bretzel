"""The ``loading=`` wiring shared by Button and IconButton.

Both components have the same loading mechanics — build the spinner
early, lock the button during the async window, and mutex the spinner
against the leading icon — and only the dressing around differs (Button
inserts a label and a right icon, IconButton has only a glyph).

These three pieces lived in duplicate (audit F09). The mutex wrapper
itself (``Component._cloak_show``) was already a base-layer primitive:
what was left unshared is the early construction of the spinner, the
``loading || disabled`` OR-combine, and the glue that assembles them.
