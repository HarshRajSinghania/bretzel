"""Default :class:`Avatar` theme.

Round (or square) image / initials chip with an optional status dot
overlaid in the bottom-right corner.

Slots :
- ``root``    : ``relative inline-flex`` wrapper that hosts the image
                / initials and the status dot
- ``image``   : the ``<img>`` tag (covers root)
- ``initials``: fallback ``<span>`` with the user's initials
- ``status``  : tiny status dot (online / busy / etc.)

Variants :

- ``soft`` (default): a 10 % tint and the colour as ink. Right for a
  list of people on a page, where the disc must not out-shout the name
  beside it.
- ``solid``: the full colour and its derived foreground. For a disc
  that IS the information — a card's owner on a board — and for dark
  surfaces, where the 10 % tint lands within 1.1:1 of the card it sits
  on and the disc disappears.
