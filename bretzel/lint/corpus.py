"""Discovering an app's files, and their AST — **with no floor**.

That is what makes the tool portable, and it deserves writing down: the
124 gates in ``tests/consistency/`` fuse *the rule* with *THIS
repository's corpus and its non-vacuity floor* (``EXAMPLES_FLOOR`` and
friends). A gate is right to do so — it protects a known corpus. A tool
aimed at **any app** cannot: it knows nothing of the expected size.

Hence the split: here we discover and parse, never judging the
population. The floors stay on the gates' side, which become
**consumers** of this module on their own corpus.

# testable. One single question escapes that frame:
# ``ui.button(variant="brand")`` is correct **if** a
# ``Theme(components={"button": {"variants": {"brand": …}}})`` exists —
# and that theme nearly always lives in ANOTHER file. Without the corpus,
# the rule would condemn the documented escape hatch for deviating from
# the shipped theme, that is to say precisely the form we recommend.
#
# ``contextvars`` and not a module variable: the charter's anti-rule 2
# forbids mutable global state and explicitly allows registries scoped to
# a call. Unbound = an empty tuple, so a rule called outside ``run`` (a
# unit test) degrades cleanly instead of breaking.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A rule reports on one module, but those reading ``current()`` compute
# the same thing for each of them. Without memoisation, ``run`` becomes
# quadratic: measured on 2026-08-27, ``value-outside-table`` re-walked the
# AST of ``examples/``'s 322 files for each of those 322 files, so
# **56 s** — on its own two thirds of the lint baseline, and ~110 s of a
# bare ``pytest``'s 230 s (it is paid twice: the rule alone, then the
# baseline).
#
# The memo lives in the BINDING, not in a global cache: its lifetime is
# exactly the pass's, so two ``run`` over two corpora cannot contaminate
# each other, and the charter's anti-rule 2 holds. Outside ``run`` (a rule
# called on its own in a unit test), there is no binding: we build without
# memoising rather than write into a default shared by every caller.
