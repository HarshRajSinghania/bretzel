"""REFERENCE — The browser.

What Bretzel can ask of the user's machine: copy, print, go full screen,
share, vibrate — plus serving a file and getting itself installed as an
application.

Chapter written on 2026-09-02, because these three families arrived on
the same day and none had a narrative. They already appeared in the cheat
sheet — the classification gate requires it — but a list says a thing
exists, not what it costs nor where it breaks.

⚠️ The signatures and the needs are INTROSPECTED
(``describe_ui_symbol`` / ``callable_signature``). What is written by
hand here are the traps — and each one was measured, not assumed.

⚠️ **Every section lives in a ``ui.card``, and it took noticing by eye.**
It was the repository's ONLY page without a single card — measured:
``theme`` has twelve, ``structure`` seven, ``actions_client`` six,
``state_server`` five, and this one zero. So its sections floated
straight on the page background, and it looked like no other.
