"""TOPIC — Authentication.

The split was written on 2026-08-24, and it is not the one people think:

**Bretzel owns the identity and its transport** — the signed cookie, its
expiry, its anti-fixation rotation, the ``@auth.source`` read chain, the
``@auth.door`` OAuth/OIDC doors, and the ``UserState`` scope that exists
ONLY through that auth.

**The app owns the proof** — the password, the accounts table, the
roles, and the decision to accept this person.

⚠️ The charter's old line — "just the middleware hooks, the app does its
own auth" — was wrong in both directions: the framework already shipped
far more, and an app resolving its own user got a 401.
