"""TOPIC — Lists and tables.

Two neighbouring capabilities, and it is the same need at two scales:
showing a collection that moves without re-rendering the whole page.

- ``ui.each`` / ``filter_each`` / ``paginate_each`` — the author writes
  the body, the framework sets the key and the client-side hiding;
- ``ui.datatable`` — the component owns the loop, because it sorts,
  filters, paginates and exports.

That difference is not a matter of taste: it is the base layer's
``COLLECTION_OWNER`` rule. **Whoever writes the ``for`` decides the API's
shape.** The author writes the loop → a ``with`` and children; the
component writes it → a ``render=``. Gated by
``test_collection_owner_decides_the_api``.
