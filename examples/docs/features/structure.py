"""REFERENCE — App structure.

The flat app: features at one level that decorate themselves, a ``main``
that ``include``s them, a ``core`` for the global-only. No ``app/``
folder. These docs ARE a flat app — they take themselves as the example.

⚠️ **What this page announced less of than the framework.** It listed
three decorators — ``@page`` / ``@layout`` / ``@error_page`` — under the
title "the three feature roles". There are eleven, and above all it
mentioned ``Feature`` nowhere, the contract declaring what a feature
provides and what it depends on, checked as a graph at startup.

Hence the structural correction: **the decorator table RESOLVES every
symbol it names** (:data:`MARQUEURS`), and the ``Feature`` kinds are read
from ``FEATURE_KINDS``, imported through its layer's public door —
``bretzel.server``, and not ``bretzel.server.feature``, which the gate
``test_no_example_dives_below_a_public_door`` refuses (it bit here on the
first attempt). A page that names a vanished decorator says so on screen
instead of letting it be believed, and
``test_the_structure_chapter_names_real_decorators`` makes it blush
first.
