"""REFERENCE — The client runtime.

What the browser runs once the page has arrived: a signal engine, the
`bz-*` directives, and a bridge that owns the transport boundary. A
reference chapter: one does not write these directives by hand in a
Bretzel app — the components emit them. One comes to read it when
stepping outside the frame, or to know what is running.

Every table is introspected from `bretzel/runtime/`: the vocabulary
declared on the Python side, checked against what the JS really wires. No
count is written into this page.
