"""TOPIC — Drag and drop.

Two components and one object: one declares the zone that ACCEPTS, the
element that IS PICKED UP, and the handler receives what comes from
where and where it goes.

``accepts=`` controls entry from another zone; by default a zone only
reorders its own items. ``locked=`` controls exit, ``holds="one"`` controls
capacity, and ``terminal=True`` marks an action target such as an archive.
