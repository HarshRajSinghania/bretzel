"""TOPIC — Keeping a page alive without anybody clicking.

``ui.interval`` is an INVISIBLE component: it draws nothing, it fires. An
`on_tick` every N seconds, and a flag that stops it.

What is worth writing down, because it is the design choice: the cadence
lives in the PAGE, not in a server task. A closed tab stops ticking on
its own — there is nothing to cancel, no life cycle to hold, and an app
that restarts leaves no orphan timer.
