**Recurring invoices** are here. Set a schedule once and Northwind sends,

- Invoices now support **multiple currencies** per customer
- Faster exports: a 50,000-row CSV takes *under two seconds*
- The `/v1/invoices` endpoint accepts an `idempotency_key`

Read the [migration guide](https://docs.bretzel-py.dev) before upgrading.
